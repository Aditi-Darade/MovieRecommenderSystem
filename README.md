Content-based machine learning model for movie recommendations:

Preprocessed the data to fit the system's needs. Created a machine learning model that utilized the Nearest Neighbours algorithm through text-to-vector conversion using the bag of words technique. The vector representation of movies in a two-dimensional space was used to find similar movies with the highest cosine similarity between the vector lines of those respective movies. Used Jupyter Notebook and Python3 for the backend and PyCharm for the front end. Deployed using Render
